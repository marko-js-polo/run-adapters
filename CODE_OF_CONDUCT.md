# Marko Polo - Contributor Code of Conduct

Hey there! ðŸ‘‹ Welcome to the Marko Polo community projects.

We're all about building awesome stuff for the Marko ecosystem together. To make sure this remains a fun and productive space for everyone, we have a few simple guidelines. Think of them less as strict rules and more as friendly reminders to keep things cool.

## The Core Idea: Be Nice to Each Other

Seriously, that's mostly it. We're building on open source, which thrives on collaboration and mutual respect.

*   **Be Respectful:** Treat everyone with kindness, patience, and empathy. We all come from different backgrounds and have different experience levels. Disagreements happen, but keep discussions focused on the code and ideas, not personal attacks.
*   **Be Collaborative:** Share your ideas, offer constructive feedback (and be open to receiving it!), and help others out when you can. Pull requests, issue comments, discussions â€“ it's all part of the collective effort.
*   **Be Mindful:** Remember that communication online can sometimes lack nuance. Choose your words thoughtfully. If something seems off, assume good intentions first.
*   **Keep it Welcoming:** We want everyone to feel comfortable participating, regardless of their identity, background, or skill level. Avoid exclusionary language or behavior.

## What We're Not About

Basically, anything that goes against being nice to each other. This includes:

*   Harassment, trolling, or any form of bullying.
*   Discriminatory jokes or language.
*   Unwelcome advances or comments.
*   Any other behavior that makes someone feel unsafe or unwelcome.

## If Things Get Weird

If you see or experience behavior that doesn't align with this code of conduct, or if you just have concerns, please reach out privately to the project maintainers (you can usually find them via the GitHub repository). We'll handle it discreetly and appropriately.

## Thanks!

Thanks for being part of Marko Polo and helping us keep it a positive and creative corner of the internet!
